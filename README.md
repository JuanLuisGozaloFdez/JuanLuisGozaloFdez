Hi everyone.

I am an IT engineer with mainly interest in Robotics and AI.

Working now as IT professor in the [Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR)]( https://www.unir.net/) in the [DevOps Expert Course](https://www.unir.net/ingenieria/curso-devops-cloud-computing-produccion-software/) and in the [Blockchain Expert Course]( https://estudiar.unir.net/es/es-esp-cu-ing-curso-blockchain/).

And, just now, Iâ€™m practicing in ML models for robotic.
